I am a first-year PhD student under the supervision of [Jean-Fran√ßois Bonastre](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P1-Ar8MAAAAJ&hl=fr) at Inria Paris. Prior to that, I worked as a research engineer at [Kinetix](https://www.kinetix.tech/), where I developed 3D pose estimation models.

My current research focuses on deep learning for audio processing, specifically on developing an automated audio scene description system. This system aims to extract key information such as referenced people, places, and events.
